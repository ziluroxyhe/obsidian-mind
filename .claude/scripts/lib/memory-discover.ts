/**
 * Discovery and self-healing for the vault memory layer.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 *
 * Every hardcoded path and every config key in this layer is a promise the user
 * can break without knowing. They rename `memories/` in Obsidian; they
 * reorganise `brain/`; they move the vault folder; the template moves its own
 * scripts. Nothing errors — the server simply stops finding things, and
 * "returns nothing" is indistinguishable from "there is nothing", which is the
 * failure mode that cost the most time building this layer.
 *
 * So: DERIVE, don't declare. Config becomes an override for the rare case where
 * derivation is wrong, not the mechanism everything depends on. Where a value
 * genuinely cannot be derived, it gets reported by `health()` rather than
 * failing quietly.
 *
 * Modelled on this template's qmd bootstrap: detect current state, repair what
 * can be repaired, migrate from a legacy shape, stay idempotent, and say out
 * loud when it healed something.
